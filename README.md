# File-Sharing-System

The Multi-Client File Server Application is a robust file-sharing system enabling seamless interaction between clients and a central server repository. It supports essential operations like uploading, downloading, listing, and deleting files, allowing clients to manage server-stored data effectively. Built with multi-threading using gcc -pthread, the application facilitates concurrent connections, enabling multiple clients to interact with the server simultaneously. Communication between the client and server is handled over a hardcoded port (8080), ensuring efficient data exchange. This tool is ideal for distributed teams requiring centralized file storage and retrieval.
